/*
 * pty_bridge: Android-guest HCI H4 <-> Cirque Virtual Bluetooth TCP bridge.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * -------
 * The Android emulator's Bluetooth HAL (android.hardware.bluetooth-service)
 * talks HCI H4 (UART framing) to a character device. By default that device
 * is backed by the emulator's built-in Bluetooth simulator, which Cirque does
 * not use. This program runs *inside the Android guest* and replaces that
 * device with a pseudo-terminal whose far end is a TCP connection to Cirque's
 * userspace VirtualBluetoothServer running on the host. The Android stack
 * then shares the same virtual LE link layer as the Docker IoT end devices,
 * so CHIPTool can do BLE PASE against chip-all-clusters-app with no kernel
 * modules, no bluetoothd, and no emulator radio daemons involved.
 *
 * DATA PATH
 * ---------
 *   Android BT HAL  --H4 bytes-->  /dev/bluetooth0 (symlink)
 *                                      |
 *                                      v  PTY slave
 *                               pty_bridge (PTY master)
 *                                      |
 *                                      v  TCP, TCP_NODELAY
 *                 VirtualBluetoothServer <host_ip>:<port> (host side)
 *                                      |
 *                                      v
 *                 Cirque virtual controller + LE link layer relay
 *
 * The bridge is byte-transparent: it does not parse H4. Framing, HCI command
 * and event handling, and link-layer relay all live in the Cirque server
 * (cirque/virtual_bt/{server,controller,link_layer}.py).
 *
 * WIRE PROTOCOL
 * -------------
 * Immediately after connecting, the bridge sends one ASCII line:
 *
 *     BIND <bind_id>\n
 *
 * This is the VirtualBluetoothServer "raw H4 bind" handshake: it tells the
 * server which virtual controller id (default "android_hci0") this TCP
 * stream carries. Everything after that line, in both directions, is raw H4.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *     pty_bridge <pty_symlink_path> <host_ip> <port> [bind_id]
 *
 *   pty_symlink_path  Path the HAL opens, e.g. /dev/bluetooth0. Any existing
 *                     file at this path is unlinked and replaced by a symlink
 *                     to the freshly allocated PTY slave (chmod 0666 so the
 *                     bluetooth uid can open it).
 *   host_ip           IPv4 address of the host running the Cirque server, as
 *                     seen from the guest (typically the Docker gateway).
 *   port              TCP port of VirtualBluetoothServer's H4 listener.
 *   bind_id           Virtual controller id for the BIND line
 *                     (default: android_hci0).
 *
 * The Python side (cirque/nodes/androiddockernode.py, start_pty_bridge)
 * pushes this binary to /data/local/tmp, launches it, and then restarts the
 * guest's bt_vhci_forwarder / Bluetooth HAL so the HAL reopens the symlink.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE
 * ---------
 *   1. Allocate a PTY master (posix_openpt/grantpt/unlockpt), raw mode.
 *   2. Connect to <host_ip>:<port>, send "BIND <bind_id>\n".
 *   3. Point <pty_symlink_path> at the PTY slave.
 *   4. poll() both fds and copy bytes PTY->TCP and TCP->PTY until the TCP
 *      peer closes, a fatal I/O error occurs, or SIGINT/SIGTERM arrives.
 *   5. Print byte counters for each direction and exit 0.
 *
 * The symlink is created *after* the TCP connection succeeds so the HAL
 * never attaches to a PTY with no server behind it. EIO on the PTY master
 * is tolerated: it is what Linux returns while no process has the slave
 * open (e.g. while the HAL restarts).
 *
 * EXIT CODES
 * ----------
 *   0  clean shutdown (signal, peer closed, or poll error after start)
 *   1  bad arguments
 *   2  posix_openpt failed
 *   3  grantpt failed
 *   4  unlockpt failed
 *   5  ptsname failed
 *   6  socket() failed
 *   7  host_ip is not a valid IPv4 address
 *   8  connect() failed (server not reachable)
 *   9  write of the BIND line failed
 *  10  symlink() failed
 *
 * BUILD
 * -----
 * Built by build_pty_bridge.sh with the Android NDK as a *static* x86_64
 * binary (API 34) so it has no dependency on guest libc versions and runs
 * from /data/local/tmp on the emulator image used by Cirque.
